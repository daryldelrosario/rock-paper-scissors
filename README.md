## Brief Description
This is a JavaScript program built from scratch.   

It is a five round program of the school-grade game 'Rock-Paper-Scissors'.   

`For JavaScript Only:`   
The program prompts the user to choose between 'Rock-Paper-Scissors' and the computer has a function that randomly generates an option for each round.   

`For Build User Interface:`   
Built a basic UI to allow User to choose Rock-Paper-Scissors and track the progress for five rounds. After five rounds, game finishes and checks to see if the user wants to `Play Again?`.
